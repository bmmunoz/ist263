    Benjamin Munoz
    I’m a Data Analytics major with a passion for exploring statistical patterns in sports. I’m particularly interested in using data to uncover trends and insights that can enhance how teams make decisions.
    
    Accomplishments & Skills:
    •	First-generation college student
    •	Bilingual (fluent in English and Spanish) and currently learning Mandarin
    
    Who I Am Outside of School:
    I’m the youngest of three siblings and from the Bronx, NYC. I’m a big sports fan that attends various sporting events. I collect baseball bobbleheads, and I spend my summer attending games in New York City for both Mets and Yankees. When I’m not at a game, I’m watching my current favorite show, The Rookie.
