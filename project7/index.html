                <p>Few rivalries in sports are as intense as the one between the Yankees and the Boston Red Sox. Dating back more than a century, this rivalry has featured historic comebacks, heated debates, and unforgettable clashes. The inner-city rivalry with the New York Mets adds even more energy, during Subway Series games. And in recent years, matchups with the Tampa Bay Rays have also grown more competitive and emotional. Yankees rivalries bring out the passion of the team and its loyal fans.</p>
