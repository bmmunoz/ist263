                <p>Yankee Stadium is located in the heart of the Bronx, making it easily accessible from most parts of New York City. The most convenient way to get there is by subway, especially on game days when traffic can be heavy. Take the 4, B, or D train to 161st Street - Yankee Stadium station, which drops you off right by the entrance. Subway travel is not only quicker but also more affordable than parking options nearby. For out-of-town visitors, the area is safe during events, offering a smooth travel experience to and from the game.</p>

                <p>Yankee Stadium offers a wide variety of food options to satisfy every fan’s cravings.

Vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free options are also available at select vendors. Beverage options include everything from soda and water to craft beers and frozen cocktails. Make sure to explore different sections of the stadium, as each level often features exclusive items or local New York favorites.

                <img src="../images/gameday.png" alt="Yankees fans cheering">
                <p>The energy at Yankee Stadium on gameday is electric. Fans arrive early to snap photos and sing along with the crowd. Monument Park is a must-see for fans wanting to honor the legends of Yankees history before the game begins. One of the most unique traditions is the Roll Call, where the Bleacher Creatures in right field chant the names of each starting fielder until they respond with a wave or gesture. Whether you're seated behind home plate or up in the bleachers, the passion of the fans and the spirit of the Yankees are felt in every inning.</p>
